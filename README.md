# waveform-classification-with-machineLearning
This repo contains the codes written in PyTorch to distinguish between the pileup waveforms and single waveforms via machine learning approach using different neural networks. 

Pileup waveforms are itself generated using two single waveforms. The single waveforms are taken from a single germanium detector from the calibration data of the Majorana Demonstrator (MJD) experiment.
